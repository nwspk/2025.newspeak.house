Every year, the cohort is meant to define its own norms. We’re all peers. In theory, no one needs permission to act. In fact, many cohort members feel empowered by this - that they don't need anyone's permission, that they'll just do what they want. I really admire that!\n\nAnd yet, despite understanding the idea logically and wanting to be that person, I notice that I do need permission.\n\nWhat was difficult to convey is that don’t experience this as a lack of confidence. Although that is feedback that I receive constantly in corporate contexts. I know I can lead. I know I’m capable.\n\nBut when it comes to starting programs, proposing policies, or changing how the house operates, I feel a strong pull toward structure: a document, a principle, a process I can point to. Something that legitimizes action.\n\nPart of this may come from my vocation. As an engineer, I’m comfortable with rules, systems, and explicit structure. Ambiguity can feel blocking rather than freeing.\n\nBut I don’t think that’s the full story.\n\nI suspect this instinct is more deeply political. As someone who has experienced marginalization, I’ve learned through real consequences that acting without permission in the world often carries risk. In many systems, people like me are penalized more harshly for stepping outside informal or unspoken boundaries. Over time, that teaches you to seek cover: consensus, legitimacy, shared responsibility.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that this instinct disappears when harm or safety is at stake. In moments involving psychological safety or code-of-conduct violations, I don’t feel the need for permission. I act, because the moral imperative is clear. And I act because I have the experience to know to act in the best interests of the victim - I’ve done this before.\n\nBut in cases of governance or experimentation, I hesitate, not because I don’t care - in fact I care a LOT, but because I’m still carrying the outside world into a space that claims to be free of it.\n\nThis makes me wonder whether I’m still operating as if systemic oppression is present, even in a place intentionally designed to suspend it. And if that’s true, what does it mean for prefigurative politics? If we’re trying to model new forms of governance inside the house, but we arrive with deeply internalized norms shaped by unequal systems, how do we unlearn those things? Is the design of the course meant to challenge the invisible norms that we bring with us?\n\nNow I’m wondering how invisible histories or invisible norms shape behavior, even in spaces that imagine themselves as neutral. And before anyone says it - no space is ever truly neutral. Even in a space like Newspeak House, with the explict standard of being without rules and everyone can set rules - there are explicit structures of privelege (e.g the people who feel they can act w/o any structural legitimacy prove that).Is learning to act differently is part of the political education I came here for?

When I push on this, my allies in the house say, “well that’s life” or “well that’s politics”\n\nIs it? I’ve been trying to understand why this answer feels unsatisfying to me. This isn’t the politics that I came to practice at the house, this is the politics of convincing people that the legitimacy and value of a thing that I thought they already had bought into.\n\nI came into this fellowship believing that opting in meant opting into the governance module, that we were agreeing, as a collective, by the rules we would design, test, contest, and revise together. I thought that engagement, at the very least was required, not agreement. But other cohort members seem to have opted into a much narrower version of the fellowship: shared house, shared conversations, and this optional play in the sandbox that can’t ever _really_ constrain them.\n\nThose are very different constitutional assumptions.\n\nWhat I’m noticing is that we keep trying to debate _policies_ without ever settling what would make a rule binding in the first place. Every time a proposal is raised, the conversation snaps back to legitimacy: _why should this count? why should I care? why should I comply?_ That snap-back blocks the kind of political disagreement I actually want.\n\nI want people to fight me on implementation details, on scope, on enforcement, on harm. I want to argue about whether a digital ID at the door produces exclusion, or whether differentiated access rules create power in ways we don’t want. But instead of those debates, I keep encountering a deeper refusal: _the suggestion that no rule here could ever be binding, regardless of how it’s designed._\n\nReading excerpts from _Max Weber, Economy and Society (authority & legitimacy)_ and _Elinor Ostrom, Governing the Commons_ has helped me name what feels off. Authority doesn’t persist because it’s declared - it persists because people _treat_ it as legitimate. Rules can only stay alive if people who follow them can shape them, when there are shared expectations, and when there are consequences to refusal. I’ve been told that the institution would support compliance to signed charters via forms of exclusion - but I don’t believe in that form of compliance. I would rather have people opt in somehow.\n\nThat realization reframes a lot of the frustration I’ve been feeling. I’m trying to run experiments in a system that hasn’t decided whether it wants to be governable at all. The governance _experiments_ aren’t being rejected, they’re just not participating.\n\nThat’s a valid choice, but it changes what this place is and it changes the way that the 3-4 of us who believe in the experiments will experience the fellowship as we understood it.\n\nWithout that shared commitment to the legitimacy of the governance module, governance becomes this optional performance, this sandbox game that a few are playing in the house that has no real power or impact or authority. That lack of interest in the opportunity and space and resources we have been given to play around with, it actively demoralizes me.\n\nFor those of us who came here believing this was a rare, unique space to test rules, norms, and systems with real stakes, that decision quietly redraws the boundaries of the fellowship itself - and I don’t know if I want to work within those limits.",

After conversations with Ed and faculty, it’s gotten sharper, but I’m still not sure what this experience really is, or whether it has political viability.\n\nThere’s a thing that happens in groups that I care about where critique becomes the dominant point of conversation. Not critique as analysis or disagreement, but critique as posture, where the “system” we exist in whether that’s the cohort or an open source team, is fundamentally broken, the powers that be are “irredeemable” and nothing short of total rejection is acceptable.\n\nAnd I find that in groups like these, over time, there’s a hostility to hope.\n\nAs someone who tries to cradle a tiny flame of optimism, I find it challenged as naivety. Attempts to contextualize, or to reason about what might still be possible, the opportunity space ahead of us, are met with suspicion or ridicule as a gut reaction.\n\nI’ve also encountered this in open source communities I’ve volunteered in. Once an “enemy” of sorts is established, it becomes a very tricky operation to propose any kind of compromise without looking complicit. But without compromise, nothing actually resolves. Volunteers get no closure. The community can’t move forward in a way that preserves the sustainability of either the people or the project.\n\nThis dynamic seems to find me in every group, team, or company I’m part of (or perhaps it is a pattern that I find myself drawn to as a result of caring for the building of communities?) And it crushes my hope. Not because I disagree with the critique, I often share it, but because there’s no room left for action. There’s no space to be curious, to imagine moving forward, to repair, iterate, or make partial progress. The only acceptable stance seems to be collective fatalism.\n\nMost recently, I feel this in my sense of purpose in the fellowship. I’m here because I believe deeply in the vision, in building, testing, and intervening in systems and experiments that I know have failed me in the real world, and through that, learning politics by doing. But when optimism becomes socially risky, I start to feel like I don’t fit, like I need to shrink my hopes and ambitions to meet the moment.\n\nIf I’m lucky, there are people who replenish my optimism, because they, too, feel unheard and feel the weight of the current political situation pressing on them. The Americans in the cohort, for example, share a kind of implicit understanding of purpose. They understand this political moment, sense that something is shifting, and feel called, like I do, to do more. Those conversations restore my energy and clarity. They remind me why I care and why I moved my entire life to be here. But when I feel replenished and return to conversations at the house, the group norm reasserts itself. I find myself grasping at the threads of hope I had so carefully braided earlier that week, or even earlier that day.\n\nWhat makes this especially difficult is that I care deeply about the individuals in this group. Their opinions and feelings matter to me. I want to stay engaged, and leaving feels like abandonment or like minimizing their pain. This in-between space is really a rocky road and I find myself feeling drained more often than I am replenished. I also don't want to withdraw entirely.\n\nIn the past, I’ve only been “successful” in navigating this when I was given a clear charter of power. In open source, that meant asking maintainers to step away when their positions were no longer serving them or the project, especially when they were silencing newer, curious voices who wanted to work rather than only critique. In corporate environments, it meant reassigning responsibilities and holding people accountable for the work they were meant to do. In situations like this where I didn't have agency to change anything, I usually burned out trying to recapture my hope week after week and eventually left the organization.\n\nMaybe that’s the only way I know how to handle this.

In open source, that meant asking maintainers to step away when their positions were no longer serving them or the project, especially when they were silencing newer, curious voices who wanted to work rather than only critique. In corporate environments, it meant reassigning responsibilities and holding people accountable for the work they were meant to do. In situations like this where I didn't have agency to change anything, I usually burned out trying to recapture my hope week after week and eventually left the organization.</p>\n<p>Maybe that’s the only way I know how to handle this. Or maybe there are other routes, working at the individual level, explicitly building a group of people who still have hope, and naming what’s happening out loud so we can refill each other’s energy intentionally.</p>\n<p>Being able to name this pattern feels important. If I can see it clearly, maybe I can build a skill for living with it or intervening without losing my hope next time.</p>\n<p>Open questions:</p>\n<p>•\tHow do groups reset norms once they’ve drifted this way?</p>\n<p>•\tWhat are the early signs that you're headed this way?</p>\n<p>•\tAt what point does naming harm stop creating capacity and start eroding it?</p>\n",

As I understand it so far, the difference is less about having many agents and more about how coordination works.\n\nKimi’s swarm is framed as a trainable orchestration via Parallel-Agent RL. Multiple agents act at the same time, and a reward signal trains how they divide work, share information, sequence actions, or override each other. Coordination isn’t written out as rules; it’s something that emerges from training, because certain collaboration patterns get higher rewards. Agents can be spawned dynamically, and control can shift between them, there isn’t a permanently fixed supervisor.\n\nIn contrast, the supervisor pattern I’m familiar with has an explicit orchestrator (the controller) that decides tasks, splits them up, orders execution, and aggregates outputs from specialist agents. The coordination logic lives in code or prompts, and the other agents are mostly workers or tools. It’s a more inspectable setup (to a degree).\n\nWhat I think is “special” about Kimi’s swarm, at least in how it’s being framed, is that coordination itself is *learned*, not predefined. The agents learn how to work together, and in theory, the system can adapt its collaboration strategy across tasks without new orchestration code.\n\nStill very much a note-to-self!

        "body": "## 📔 Field Note: Before we come for Managers, we need to look at Organizations\n\nI suppose the purpose of this class session was \"Do we still Managers?\" and will AI replace them? I fully expected Peyman to present us with question early on. Instead, we dove into the meta a bit. Before we can really analyze the role of managers in organizations, need to talk about organizations themselves - and how they evolve (and sometimes don't).\n\n### organizational paradigms\n\nIn “[Reinventing Organizations](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=work_week_41_2018_three_categories_of_human_organizations&utm_term=2018-10-12)”, author Frederic Laloux writes that “_\\[a\\]n organization cannot evolve beyond its leadership’s stage of \\[consciousness\\]._” He describes specific stages of organizational paradigms:\n\n- **Red** - organizations ruled with a absolute power, limited to the immediate reach and influence of their leader. Red organizations are often described as wolf packs or the mafia. Everyone is motivated by fear, change is management can happen through a change in power dynamics.\n- **Amber** - organizations with a top down conformist structure of power with rigid stages of management and hierarchies to pass down stable, replicable processes to large groups of people. Consider the Catholic Church or an army.\n- **Orange** - typical organizations that make decisions based on evidence, acting like machines - setting goals, breaking those into benchmarks or OKRS, and then working towards them. These goals can be driven by shareholder value for example. Most companies exist at this orange stage.\n- **Green** - a newer model for organizations that is values driven, with a culture of empowerment, multi stakeholders that share in decisions and benefits of those decisions. Individuals in these organizations are able to drive things forward.\n- **Teal** - is an evolutionary model for organizations - where everyone is a manager, and everyone has the autonomy and authority to fix issues themselves. Distributed, remote teams are in a key position to take advantage of this new model, because the architecture and real estate of a physical workspace can’t play into reinforcing a hierarchy.\n\nWhat struck me about this analysis of organizational paradigms was slotting in the organizations that I've worked for and reflecting on how they've moved along the scale - which is certainly not linear. Because in every organization, there are pockets of teal - where employees have autonomy and authority to act, vs pockets of red - where a VP might have absolute power, say, and control. I also considered the fact that organizations don't always evolve forward, they often regress.\n\nUnder the pressure of the market, scarce resources, or industry's rapid change, even mature green organizations can slide back into tightly controlled, slower decision processes, and higher amounts of centralization. For example, towards an IPO, even the employees with the most autonomy might find themselves following beauocratic hierarchical processes due to compliance needs.\n\nA question that was posed in class was -  _**in a genuinely good culture or system, can you leave it up to people to decide what they should do?**_ this is an interesting one to think about in reference to AI agents and the future of work.\n\n### organizational reshuffles\n\nOrganisational reshuffles is also an interesting lens here. When structures change, people often _rethink the organisation itself,_ its values, its rules, what is actually allowed. That moment of ambiguity can feel destabilising, but it might also be one of the few times real reflection becomes possible. Space to rethink isn’t always a failure mode; sometimes it’s the point.\n\n### activity - management activities\n\nWe ran an activity in class: list “management activities” and then sort them into categories:\n\nthings that don’t need management at all, things that are necessary and centralized, things that may be necessary depending on context, and things that aren’t necessary.\n\nThe exercise quietly dismantled the idea that “management” is a single role. Instead, it’s a bundle of functions, some structural, some cultural, some political. And some bundles of tasks, we found over discussion, weren't even necessary for the manager to do.\n\n**Doesn’t have to be management**\n* Organising product\n* Project management (doesn’t need to be centralised)\n* Time allocation\n* Initiative / experimentation\n\n**Necessary and centralised**\n* Consensus mechanisms\n* Policy enforcement\n* Core strategy / value-setting (emerging core strategy / value team)\n\n**Can be necessary (context-dependent)**\n* Product management (depends on scale and cross-functionality)\n* Project management (varies by context)\n* Governance under scarcity\n* Resource prioritisation during limited resources or reshuffles\n\n**Not necessary**\n* Vision setting\n* “Corporate BS”\n\nThis is where the fantasy of fully distributed, future-leaning teams started to fray. Many such models assume abundance: enough time, enough money, enough attention. In reality, teams operate under limited resources. You can decentralise how people allocate their time, but the _consensus mechanisms_ - what ultimately gets prioritised, funded, or enforced - often remain centralised. Scarcity pulls authority back toward the centre.\n\nProduct and project management surfaced as examples. In theory, they could be decentralized. In practice, they rarely are, especially when dependencies stack up. Policy enforcement, even more so, tends to centralize by necessity. This isn’t a moral failure; it’s an organizational gravity well.\n\n#### culture vs process\n\nThat tension showed up again in the discussion of culture versus process. Is it more important to have a handbook, or an open form of discussion? A static policy, or a living document? The more interesting framing wasn’t either/or, but _what the handbook actually does_. Handbooks are often ignored and yet they generate discussion. People argue with them, interpret them, feel constrained or protected by them. Their real value may lie less in compliance and more in the sense-making they provoke.\n\nWhich leads to a harder question: **is there a level of discomfort we should be willing to tolerate in order to create the change we say we want?**\n\nExpense policies is another example. Clear rules can feel restrictive, but they also reduce ambiguity and unfairness. Looser, emergent norms can feel freer, but risk uneven application and hidden power. Is it possible to evolve policies that are flexible _and_ fair, freer in practice, without abandoning guidance or reasonableness?\n\n### bias for action\n\nWanting people to try things and learn from attempts isn’t enough. You have to make it _successful to try_. Bias for action turns out to be a skill, not a slogan and it has maturity levels. At its best, it looks like controlled experimentation, not reckless motion. It requires scaffolding.\n\n#### python vs C\n\nTo illustrate this situation, let's take a look at two programming languages.\n\nPython encourages action: forgiving defaults, fast feedback, easy rollback.\n\nC demands precision, upfront correctness, and carries higher consequences for mistakes.\n\nNeither is inherently better (although you might find that enthusiasts disagree with this take) but they produce very different behaviors. Organizations, like languages, encode values into their constraints.\n\nSome conditions for a healthy bias-for-action culture are:\n\n- fast feedback mechanisms and rollback paths,\n- well-understood impact and blast radius,\n- frameworks for experimentation with explicit gates for lower risk,\n- and crucially, structure even in “permission-less” environments.\n\n#### permission-less cultures\n\nI probably need a whole separate field note on permission-less cultures, because I don't believe they exist - and it hit close to home. Trying to be action-oriented without clear boundaries often creates _more_ ambiguity, not less. Even anarchist systems have rules. “No permission needed” still requires shared understanding of limits.\n\nThe phrase “go and act” came up repeatedly,  mostly as a warning. It doesn’t work. For many people, playing it safe is more natural, especially in civic or institutional contexts where failure carries reputational or moral weight. Even with frameworks in place, acting can feel risky.\n\nSo the real challenge becomes perceptual: **how do you show people that the risk is actually small?** Could you test something in one year instead of three? Can you make reversibility visible? Signals matter and organizations are constantly sending them, often unintentionally.\n\n#### culture change takes time\n\nFinally, culture change takes time. It takes months for an organization to acclimate to a new culture and it happens very, very slowly. Institutional safety and psychological safety are distinct but intertwined. And that global contexts complicate everything  what feels safe, fast, or acceptable in one region may not in another.\n\nI left class with the sense that the real question isn’t whether we still need managers, but **what managers are actually for**. If autonomy is the goal, someone still has to design the conditions that make autonomy survivable.

Red organizations are often described as wolf packs or the mafia. Everyone is motivated by fear, change is management can happen through a change in power dynamics.</li>\n<li><strong>Amber</strong> - organizations with a top down conformist structure of power with rigid stages of management and hierarchies to pass down stable, replicable processes to large groups of people. Consider the Catholic Church or an army.</li>\n<li><strong>Orange</strong> - typical organizations that make decisions based on evidence, acting like machines - setting goals, breaking those into benchmarks or OKRS, and then working towards them. These goals can be driven by shareholder value for example. Most companies exist at this orange stage.</li>\n<li><strong>Green</strong> - a newer model for organizations that is values driven, with a culture of empowerment, multi stakeholders that share in decisions and benefits of those decisions. Individuals in these organizations are able to drive things forward.</li>\n<li><strong>Teal</strong> - is an evolutionary model for organizations - where everyone is a manager, and everyone has the autonomy and authority to fix issues themselves. Distributed, remote teams are in a key position to take advantage of this new model, because the architecture and real estate of a physical workspace can’t play into reinforcing a hierarchy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What struck me about this analysis of organizational paradigms was slotting in the organizations that I've worked for and reflecting on how they've moved along the scale - which is certainly not linear. Because in every organization, there are pockets of teal - where employees have autonomy and authority to act, vs pockets of red - where a VP might have absolute power, say, and control. I also considered the fact that organizations don't always evolve forward, they often regress.</p>\n<p>Under the pressure of the market, scarce resources, or industry's rapid change, even mature green organizations can slide back into tightly controlled, slower decision processes, and higher amounts of centralization. For example, towards an IPO, even the employees with the most autonomy might find themselves following beauocratic hierarchical processes due to compliance needs.</p>\n<p>A question that was posed in class was -  <em><strong>in a genuinely good culture or system, can you leave it up to people to decide what they should do?</strong></em> this is an interesting one to think about in reference to AI agents and the future of work.</p>\n<h3>organizational reshuffles</h3>\n<p>Organisational reshuffles is also an interesting lens here. When structures change, people often <em>rethink the organisation itself,</em> its values, its rules, what is actually allowed. That moment of ambiguity can feel destabilising, but it might also be one of the few times real reflection becomes possible. Space to rethink isn’t always a failure mode; sometimes it’s the point.</p>\n<h3>activity - management activities</h3>\n<p>We ran an activity in class: list “management activities” and then sort them into categories:</p>\n<p>things that don’t need management at all, things that are necessary and centralized, things that may be necessary depending on context, and things that aren’t necessary.</p>\n<p>The exercise quietly dismantled the idea that “management” is a single role. Instead, it’s a bundle of functions, some structural, some cultural, some political. And some bundles of tasks, we found over discussion, weren't even necessary for the manager to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Doesn’t have to be management</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organising product</li>\n<li>Project management (doesn’t need to be centralised)</li>\n<li>Time allocation</li>\n<li>Initiative / experimentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Necessary and centralised</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consensus mechanisms</li>\n<li>Policy enforcement</li>\n<li>Core strategy / value-setting (emerging core strategy / value team)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Can be necessary (context-dependent)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product management (depends on scale and cross-functionality)</li>\n<li>Project management (varies by context)</li>\n<li>Governance under scarcity</li>\n<li>Resource prioritisation during limited resources or reshuffles</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Not necessary</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vision setting</li>\n<li>“Corporate BS”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is where the fantasy of fully distributed, future-leaning teams started to fray. Many such models assume abundance: enough time, enough money, enough attention. In reality, teams operate under limited resources. You can decentralise how people allocate their time, but the <em>consensus mechanisms</em> - what ultimately gets prioritised, funded, or enforced - often remain centralised. Scarcity pulls authority back toward the centre.</p>\n<p>Product and project management surfaced as examples. In theory, they could be decentralized. In practice, they rarely are, especially when dependencies stack up. Policy enforcement, even more so, tends to centralize by necessity. This isn’t a moral failure; it’s an organizational gravity well.</p>\n<h4>culture vs process</h4>\n<p>That tension showed up again in the discussion of culture versus process. Is it more important to have a handbook, or an open form of discussion? A static policy, or a living document? The more interesting framing wasn’t either/or, but <em>what the handbook actually does</em>. Handbooks are often ignored and yet they generate discussion. People argue with them, interpret them, feel constrained or protected by them. Their real value may lie less in compliance and more in the sense-making they provoke.</p>\n<p>Which leads to a harder question: <strong>is there a level of discomfort we should be willing to tolerate in order to create the change we say we want?</strong></p>\n<p>Expense policies is another example. Clear rules can feel restrictive, but they also reduce ambiguity and unfairness. Looser, emergent norms can feel freer, but risk uneven application and hidden power. Is it possible to evolve policies that are flexible <em>and</em> fair, freer in practice, without abandoning guidance or reasonableness?</p>\n<h3>bias for action</h3>\n<p>Wanting people to try things and learn from attempts isn’t enough. You have to make it <em>successful to try</em>. Bias for action turns out to be a skill, not a slogan and it has maturity levels. At its best, it looks like controlled experimentation, not reckless motion. It requires scaffolding.</p>\n<h4>python vs C</h4>\n<p>To illustrate this situation, let's take a look at two programming languages.</p>\n<p>Python encourages action: forgiving defaults, fast feedback, easy rollback.</p>\n<p>C demands precision, upfront correctness, and carries higher consequences for mistakes.</p>\n<p>Neither is inherently better (although you might find that enthusiasts disagree with this take) but they produce very different behaviors. Organizations, like languages, encode values into their constraints.</p>\n<p>Some conditions for a healthy bias-for-action culture are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fast feedback mechanisms and rollback paths,</li>\n<li>well-understood impact and blast radius,</li>\n<li>frameworks for experimentation with explicit gates for lower risk,</li>\n<li>and crucially, structure even in “permission-less” environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>permission-less cultures</h4>\n<p>I probably need a whole separate field note on permission-less cultures, because I don't believe they exist - and it hit close to home. Trying to be action-oriented without clear boundaries often creates <em>more</em> ambiguity, not less. Even anarchist systems have rules. “No permission needed” still requires shared understanding of limits.</p>\n<p>The phrase “go and act” came up repeatedly,  mostly as a warning. It doesn’t work. For many people, playing it safe is more natural, especially in civic or institutional contexts where failure carries reputational or moral weight. Even with frameworks in place, acting can feel risky.</p>\n<p>So the real challenge becomes perceptual: <strong>how do you show people that the risk is actually small?</strong> Could you test something in one year instead of three? Can you make reversibility visible? Signals matter and organizations are constantly sending them, often unintentionally.</p>\n<h4>culture change takes time</h4>\n<p>Finally, culture change takes time. It takes months for an organization to acclimate to a new culture and it happens very, very slowly. Institutional safety and psychological safety are distinct but intertwined. And that global contexts complicate everything  what feels safe, fast, or acceptable in one region may not in another.</p>\n<p>I left class with the sense that the real question isn’t whether we still need managers, but <strong>what managers are actually for</strong>. If autonomy is the goal, someone still has to design the conditions that make autonomy survivable.

I fully expected Peyman to present us with question early on. Instead, we dove into the meta a bit. Before we can really analyze the role of managers in organizations, need to talk about organizations themselves - and how they evolve (and sometimes don't).</p>\n<h3>organizational paradigms</h3>\n<p>In “<a href=\"http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=work_week_41_2018_three_categories_of_human_organizations&amp;utm_term=2018-10-12\">Reinventing Organizations</a>”, author Frederic Laloux writes that “<em>[a]n organization cannot evolve beyond its leadership’s stage of [consciousness].</em>” He describes specific stages of organizational paradigms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Red</strong> - organizations ruled with a absolute power, limited to the immediate reach and influence of their leader. Red organizations are often described as wolf packs or the mafia. Everyone is motivated by fear, change is management can happen through a change in power dynamics.</li>\n<li><strong>Amber</strong> - organizations with a top down conformist structure of power with rigid stages of management and hierarchies to pass down stable, replicable processes to large groups of people. Consider the Catholic Church or an army.</li>\n<li><strong>Orange</strong> - typical organizations that make decisions based on evidence, acting like machines - setting goals, breaking those into benchmarks or OKRS, and then working towards them. These goals can be driven by shareholder value for example. Most companies exist at this orange stage.</li>\n<li><strong>Green</strong> - a newer model for organizations that is values driven, with a culture of empowerment, multi stakeholders that share in decisions and benefits of those decisions. Individuals in these organizations are able to drive things forward.</li>\n<li><strong>Teal</strong> - is an evolutionary model for organizations - where everyone is a manager, and everyone has the autonomy and authority to fix issues themselves. Distributed, remote teams are in a key position to take advantage of this new model, because the architecture and real estate of a physical workspace can’t play into reinforcing a hierarchy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What struck me about this analysis of organizational paradigms was slotting in the organizations that I've worked for and reflecting on how they've moved along the scale - which is certainly not linear. Because in every organization, there are pockets of teal - where employees have autonomy and authority to act, vs pockets of red - where a VP might have absolute power, say, and control. I also considered the fact that organizations don't always evolve forward, they often regress.</p>\n<p>Under the pressure of the market, scarce resources, or industry's rapid change, even mature green organizations can slide back into tightly controlled, slower decision processes, and higher amounts of centralization. For example, towards an IPO, even the employees with the most autonomy might find themselves following beauocratic hierarchical processes due to compliance needs.</p>\n<p>A question that was posed in class was -  <em><strong>in a genuinely good culture or system, can you leave it up to people to decide what they should do?</strong></em> this is an interesting one to think about in reference to AI agents and the future of work.</p>\n<h3>organizational reshuffles</h3>\n<p>Organisational reshuffles is also an interesting lens here. When structures change, people often <em>rethink the organisation itself,</em> its values, its rules, what is actually allowed. That moment of ambiguity can feel destabilising, but it might also be one of the few times real reflection becomes possible. Space to rethink isn’t always a failure mode; sometimes it’s the point.</p>\n<h3>activity - management activities</h3>\n<p>We ran an activity in class: list “management activities” and then sort them into categories:</p>\n<p>things that don’t need management at all, things that are necessary and centralized, things that may be necessary depending on context, and things that aren’t necessary.</p>\n<p>The exercise quietly dismantled the idea that “management” is a single role.

And some bundles of tasks, we found over discussion, weren't even necessary for the manager to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Doesn’t have to be management</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organising product</li>\n<li>Project management (doesn’t need to be centralised)</li>\n<li>Time allocation</li>\n<li>Initiative / experimentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Necessary and centralised</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consensus mechanisms</li>\n<li>Policy enforcement</li>\n<li>Core strategy / value-setting (emerging core strategy / value team)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Can be necessary (context-dependent)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product management (depends on scale and cross-functionality)</li>\n<li>Project management (varies by context)</li>\n<li>Governance under scarcity</li>\n<li>Resource prioritisation during limited resources or reshuffles</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Not necessary</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vision setting</li>\n<li>“Corporate BS”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is where the fantasy of fully distributed, future-leaning teams started to fray.

The `Decode Taiwan Open Tech: Open source and civic tech meetup in London for latest communities updates from Taiwan` immediately caught my eye and as I expected, both g0v and Open Culture Foundation were mentioned in the description.\n\nThis really took me back - and it further reinforced why this institution is so unique and brings together so many communities that overlap and do similar kinds of work.\n\nWhen I first started out in Civic Tech in New York City, I volunteered at Personal Democracy Forum for a ticket to the conference. I was often assigned the role of greeting and guiding speakers. In 2017, 2-3 years into my early journey of civic tech - I'd come in from Boston, where I was working for the Digital Team, to volunteer. And I had the explicit honor of greeting Audrey Tang, the then Digital Minister of Taiwan, and leading her to the speakers ready room. I was an absolute fan girl and the whole interaction was a blur.\n\nLater that day, sitting in the audience - in the gallery above where the volunteers got to look over the stage, I watched - mesmerized as Audrey Tang delivered her keynote - \"STORIES FROM FROM THE FUTURE OF DEMOCRACY: TAIWAN\" describing the digital ministry's efforts to pioneer \"digital democracy\", using polis for civic participation and strategies for combatting disinformation.\n\nI was absolutely enamored with the whole thing - from the digital ministry of taiwan to g0v and their decentralized governance for managing the community. In fact, I remember talking to some of the volunteers about wanting to move to Taiwan and join g0v (you know me, I follow the spark).\n\nI made a few friends at the conference who worked in g0v efforts and we kept in touch over the years, even when I dipped out of civic tech into the private sector and then resurfaced as a Code for Canada fellow.\n\nSo it was really a walk down memory lane to see Taiwan on the schedule for Newspeak House. I reached out to the organizer of the event for a coffee chat - and they were delighted to meet, and even brought some of their friends.\n\nThe coffee chat felt like we'd known each other for years. They asked about the fellowship and then shared some advice regarding research, narrowing scope, and finding your life's purpose. It was so interesting to hear about where the OCF sits - between the civil society, efforts like g0v, and the Digital Ministry.\n\nIt reminded me of how I consider Developer Relations to be a bridge - between the product/engineers and the users/customers. And my job is being the runner, to carry information across from side to side, to translate it as best possible for the other side to be able to use of, to maintain the bridge so that they trust it enough to use it, and to make judgements about the urgency of relaying information. DevRel are basically spokespeople in governance, but they also carry so much of the product knowledge and technical expertise to be credible.\n\nRosalind and I talked about the ambiguity of research and how sometimes in finding one's life's purpose, one must sometimes look to the function and not the theme. It may be that many people I admire know exactly what they want to do with lives, they know what theme they want to impact and they works towards that goal. Other forms of purpose are acceptable beyond themes, for example - perhaps my purpose is being a facilitator of projects and people, or a bridge between systems that do not understand each other. \n\nThe visit from the Taiwan delegation gave me so much to think about because it presented a mirror to the past - a time where I was so excited about civic tech and knew very little, in contrast to now - where even though I understand the field and have made an impact, there's still so much more that I want to do. \n\nStay tuned for a field note about their presentation and all the projects I learned about!

Other forms of purpose are acceptable beyond themes, for example - perhaps my purpose is being a facilitator of projects and people, or a bridge between systems that do not understand each other.</p>\n<p>The visit from the Taiwan delegation gave me so much to think about because it presented a mirror to the past - a time where I was so excited about civic tech and knew very little, in contrast to now - where even though I understand the field and have made an impact, there's still so much more that I want to do.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for a field note about their presentation and all the projects I learned about!</p>\n",

In first grade, trying to get a free lunch was a bureaucratic rollercoaster. I felt ashamed that my father had to prove his retirement status and income in order for me to be able to eat lunch at school because we could hardly afford lunch otherwise. So that chocolate milk I had every morning when I arrived, it weighed on me heavily because we had to earn it.\n\nWhy are systems that are meant to support people so difficult to access?\n\nThere is now research that calls this “administrative burden,” the idea that paperwork, verification requirements, and documentation act as gatekeeping mechanisms even in programs designed to support low income families. I did not have that language at the time. I only knew that something about it felt wrong.\n\nCertain systems make it harder for people to access services that they need. And because of the way they are built, people may not even attempt to advocate for themselves.\n\nThis is just one of the patterns I have been reflecting on. Systems that I have observed over the years either include some people and exclude others, add friction to the process for the groups most in need, or create an intimidating process that adds too much cost.\n\nMy parents were immigrants. They emigrated to Canada and then to the United States in the 1960s, and their perspective on how to interact with systems is so different from mine. My father, in particular, saw rules as flexible, power as attainable, and systems that meant to squash the hopes and ideals of immigrants as unnecessary to pay any mind to. He would bend or navigate around systems that didn't serve him.\n\nFor example, he would sign me up for a private elementary school education, negotiate a scholarship that did not exist, and then use my academic abilities to prove it was worth it. He would convince, charm, and negotiate his way into rooms and doors that were historically closed for our people. Part of it was his ability to present as white passing and his British accent, which made him more palatable to the majority, but the bulk of it was his lived experience. Being the other in so many foreign countries gave him this innate confidence that he was owed power, owed a seat at the table, owed an audience.\n\nWhen it came to high school admissions, my neighborhood in Queens was zoned to one school. On paper, zoning looks neutral. In practice, school zones mirror housing segregation, and housing segregation mirrors income inequality. If you grow up in an underprivileged neighborhood, your local schools are likely to reflect that.\n\nMy father was not fond of the assigned school, so we went to school board meetings to try and get an exception without much luck. He would not let this go. He continued to contact the school board and talk to related officials. One day, during the summer before the semester started, he dropped by the high school he wanted me to attend and ran into the new Principal on the grounds in a t shirt and shorts because he was not expecting to meet parents. They became friends. My father explained my situation and suggested that a letter from the Principal inviting me to the school would move the process out of the school board’s hands. He agreed. With that letter, I was enrolled in the school my dad wanted for me.\n\nThe admissions process for Queens high schools seems neutral on paper, but it rewards insider knowledge. How to apply. Where to apply. Who advises you. What counts as merit. What paperwork and timing matter. What exceptions exist. Who knows about them.\n\nMy parents, and my dad especially, saw this discrepancy clearly because they had to navigate systems repeatedly, first in Canada and then in the United States.\n\nI was different. I grew up in an era where Muslims were othered in society after 9/11. We were not welcome. I internalized rules as fixed and legitimate. To me, breaking the rules was not an option. There were consequences. My father and I often got into arguments about this. I watched him bend systems and get results. I cringed. I assumed he would be punished. He rarely was. He insisted I should do the same, but I had so much discomfort around bending the rules.\n\nPower shows up in small ways. Who gets access to information early. Who understands the process.

A house with resources and faculty that we can utilize. We could govern it as a small country, with rules, policies, and processes. We could layer different systems, play prefigurative politics, and build the society that we want to see in the world.\n\nWhy is this special?\n\nBecause systems in the world exist with such layered inheritance and are hard to change precisely because they are stacked with years of precedent and rules. To change systems like retirement benefits, Medicare, school admissions, or immigration requires thinking out of the box, which is very difficult to do when you are overwhelmed within the system trying to get things done.\n\nHere, at least in theory, we are not bound by centuries of sediment.\n\nAt Newspeak House, rules are not treated as fixed inheritance. The system resets every year without full knowledge of the previous systems. It is a space where rules can be created, contested, replaced. It is where you can analyze systems as systems and prototype alternatives because you have the space to design, test, and create better systems than the ones you have interfaced with in the real world.\n\nThis feels so special and so unique because out in the real world we are always pushing against sedimented legitimacy.\n\nTo change the world in any meaningful way, we need to be able to displace systems, to analyze, shake up, and create purposeful improvements that do not simply get absorbed by the old logic.\n\nThe awards exercise is a smaller example of this. This is not about who wins the award. It is about building a system of evaluation. How do we decide, asynchronously and as a committee, what counts as impact and evidence. How do we encode our values into an algorithmic process, with or without AI. And then how do we publicly justify those decisions as part of the system we created to do these evaluations.\n\nThe core of this for me, and the part that hits home the most, is the question of legitimacy.\n\nAs a young girl, I took rules and systems and laws as the highest form of legitimacy possible. I did not believe they could be bent or modified or made an exception to. I watched my father break rules and somehow still get his way. Later in life, I watched senior officials and leadership do the same.\n\nNew systems do not displace old ones simply by being better. They displace them by earning legitimacy.\n\nMost people spend their lives navigating institutions they did not build, arguing within rules they did not write. Here, we are being handed the chance to design systems before they harden.\n\nI sometimes wonder whether that feels different depending on how you grew up. If you were always comfortable inside systems, perhaps designing one does not feel radical. But if you grew up feeling governed by rules you could not bend, watching your family fight administrative friction just to access what was promised to them, then being handed the chance to create rules from scratch feels almost unreal.\n\nAnd even here, we default to precedent. We reproduce familiar hierarchies. We hesitate to truly unsettle inherited logic.\n\nDesigning systems is heavier than criticizing them. It forces the question of authority.

On paper, zoning looks neutral. In practice, school zones mirror housing segregation, and housing segregation mirrors income inequality. If you grow up in an underprivileged neighborhood, your local schools are likely to reflect that.\n\nMy father was not fond of the assigned school, so we went to school board meetings to try and get an exception without much luck. He would not let this go. He continued to contact the school board and talk to related officials.

To change systems like retirement benefits, Medicare, school admissions, or immigration requires thinking out of the box, which is very difficult to do when you are overwhelmed within the system trying to get things done.\n\nHere, at least in theory, we are not bound by centuries of sediment.\n\nAt Newspeak House, rules are not treated as fixed inheritance. The system resets every year without full knowledge of the previous systems. It is a space where rules can be created, contested, replaced. It is where you can analyze systems as systems and prototype alternatives because you have the space to design, test, and create better systems than the ones you have interfaced with in the real world.\n\nThis feels so special and so unique because out in the real world we are always pushing against sedimented legitimacy.\n\nTo change the world in any meaningful way, we need to be able to displace systems, to analyze, shake up, and create purposeful improvements that do not simply get absorbed by the old logic.\n\nThe awards exercise is a smaller example of this. This is not about who wins the award. It is about building a system of evaluation. How do we decide, asynchronously and as a committee, what counts as impact and evidence. How do we encode our values into an algorithmic process, with or without AI. And then how do we publicly justify those decisions as part of the system we created to do these evaluations.\n\nThe core of this for me, and the part that hits home the most, is the question of legitimacy.\n\nAs a young girl, I took rules and systems and laws as the highest form of legitimacy possible. I did not believe they could be bent or modified or made an exception to. I watched my father break rules and somehow still get his way. Later in life, I watched senior officials and leadership do the same.\n\nNew systems do not displace old ones simply by being better. They displace them by earning legitimacy.\n\nMost people spend their lives navigating institutions they did not build, arguing within rules they did not write. Here, we are being handed the chance to design systems before they harden.\n\nI sometimes wonder whether that feels different depending on how you grew up. If you were always comfortable inside systems, perhaps designing one does not feel radical. But if you grew up feeling governed by rules you could not bend, watching your family fight administrative friction just to access what was promised to them, then being handed the chance to create rules from scratch feels almost unreal.\n\nAnd even here, we default to precedent. We reproduce familiar hierarchies. We hesitate to truly unsettle inherited logic.\n\nDesigning systems is heavier than criticizing them. It forces the question of authority. What gives us the right to decide what counts. What makes our process legitimate.\n\nThis house gives us something rare. The space to practice constructing legitimacy intentionally.

The audience was mesmerized. Words like “so truthful,” “objective,” and “work of art” floated around the discussion circle afterwards. People were in awe. They admired the precision of the cuts, the rhythm of the music, and noted that while it used real footage, it still managed to create a plot.\n\nI felt something else.\n\nAbout ten minutes into the film, when the mountains panned into power lines, I almost laughed because at that point it was clear to me what the film was going to present. Before that, I had been curious about the transition and where we were headed. After that, I felt I understood the thesis.\n\nShortly after, the music swells and we end on a family sitting on the sand at the beach, panning out to reveal a looming power plant behind them. I laughed quietly. Not because it was funny, and not to mock the craft, but because it felt like such an obvious rhetorical move.\n\nAs the film continued, I noticed a pattern of selection. When it zoomed in on human faces, they were often wary, blank, or distrustful. There were one or two smiling faces, but they felt incidental. Whenever it showed technology or urban advancement, it paired those images with speed, fast-paced music, and an implication of alienation: people moving urgently through subway stations, streets, or factories.\n\nIt was beautifully crafted. But I felt resistant to what it was trying to do.\n\nIt felt as though the film was asking me to dehumanize these people, to see them as extensions of machines. That was difficult for me. I saw the women placing food onto factory belts sped up 10x and thought about how physically demanding that job must be. I saw people entering subways en masse and remembered how easily I could visit my parents from the city on weekends. I saw highways filled with cars meant to disillusion me, and thought about how, for immigrant families like mine, cars represented economic mobility and access.\n\nThe film seemed to position these advances in ways that encouraged suspicion and critique, while I felt the reality was more nuanced. Have we polluted the earth through industrialism? Yes. But have we also created electronic wheelchairs, video calls, and transit systems that expand freedom and connection? Also yes.\n\nIn the discussion, people insisted the film was neutral because it used real footage. What I felt was resistance.\n\nDoes industrial modernity creates alienation? Yes, it does. Does acceleration destabilize life? Yes, it can. But there's so much more to it than just that - and the film curated one moral valence and held it without counterweight.\n\nWhile watching cars in factories, I thought of immigrant families who rely on those cars for mobility, for work, for better schools. While watching planes underscored by ominous music, I thought of reunions, migration, expanded worlds. The film abstracted humanity into masses; I hated that.\n\nIn the discussion circle, I felt slightly off. Everyone was in awe of the artistry and the messaging. I briefly wondered whether I lacked artistic capacity. But I do respect the craft. I can appreciate the juxtapositions, the rhythm, the scale. It was an experience. I simply felt myself resisting the narrative from early on. Once I recognized the device with the power lines, I lost some ability to fall into the flow, and perhaps that dulled the awe.\n\nI don’t reject the film’s concerns. I reject the exclusivity. The film presents itself as truth. I disagree because it feels like only a slice of the whole story. \n\nPerhaps my resistance comes from an instinct toward the need for nuance - an unwillingness to accept a single moral arc when the reality of modern life feels so layered. If that means I struggle to surrender to narratives that compress nuance into verdict, then that too is part of how I see the world.",
