There is a koan:

_“Master, I cannot pacify my mind”_

_“Student, go and write your bio”_

_“Master, my mind is blank now”_

_“Here, you are liberated”_

That said:

Hi, I’m Alex (born Alessandro, if you use it, I assume I did something wrong).
I gave up trying to pick “one career”, so now I mix AI engineering, coaching, and facilitation. By trade I tell artificial intelligences what to do (and sometimes they listen). In practice, I care just as much about human systems: how groups decide, relate, and grow together.

I design formats, and social processes, use facilitation systems, to enable quiet voices to be heard, surface the real issues, help communities self-organise without everything devolving into chaos or charisma contests, and at the same time making it fun.

That shows up in projects like [Relationship Cookbook](https://relationship-cookbook.com/) and [Wetwarecraft](https://wetwarecraft.com/), plus a rotating cast of retreats, unconferences, and adult playgrounds for inner work, movement, and relating.

I am a believer that "humans connecting with other humans" is our superpower and birthright: I got late to that realization (having been very shy, and still being a introvert) and I like spreading the joy.

I hold a master's degree in computer engineering back from the olden times when neural networks did not work, AI was lisp and expert systems, we did not write tests, and no one told me about Python.

I’m also a [trained IFS practitioner](https://www.ifs-collective.com/about-alex) with ~20 years of meditation and embodiment practice, and a soft spot for edges, between disciplines, people, and inner/outer worlds.

Underneath it all is a simple belief: good structures allow us into becoming more of who we actually want to be.
