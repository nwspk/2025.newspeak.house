Machine Learning Engineer at coefficient.ai consulting into UK Government. In abstract, works into department X, solving problem Y with AI Tool Z. 

Concretely, I once helped the Department of Business and Trade build flood risk simulations alongside the Royal Engineers. Disseminates where possible through PyData and PyCon talks. Loves open-source; see [Prague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyUWefY40iw), [Berlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A67P4-A4yLk ), and [Darmstadt](https://2025.pycon.de/talks/FGFFEE/ ) 

Born in Wales, and a proud Londoner. Teach First near Battersea Power Station. Climbs rocks like a fox. Ex-sangha host, has practiced right insight and right concentration at least once.

Uncreative technologist. Focused on techno-literate engagement with a cyber-physical reality. Interested in AI systemic and existential risk. Short timelines, like tight rhymes.

When I'm not winning Hackathons, I think and write about [Housing our British AI Progress](https://agenticlondoner.substack.com/)
Find me poring over chloropleth maps in pursuit of a just world.

My ambition at Newspeak House is to figure out how Ed gets the lights that deep shade of purple.
