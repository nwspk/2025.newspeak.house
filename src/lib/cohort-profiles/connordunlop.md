Connor works on advanced AI governance. Over the past five years he has been based in Brussels, working to strengthen the EU AI Act’s coverage of general purpose AI (GPAI models). With that legislation now largely settled, he has moved to London to join a small start-up building technical verification solutions to increase verifiability and trust in advanced AI.

To pursue this objective, he is leaving his role as Head of EU and Global Governance at the Ada Lovelace Institute, where he built and oversaw an EU team in Brussels. While at Ada, he led research projects on risk mitigation across the general-purpose AI value chain, from pre-market testing to post-deployment monitoring, as well as on AI liability, comparative regulation, and multilateral governance.

Connor has lived and worked across four countries. Before Ada, he worked in EU public affairs consultancy, where he led his team’s work on the EU’s AI legislation, and in a range of analytical roles for the UN Refugee Agency, The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, and at a public affairs consultancy in his home city, Belfast.
