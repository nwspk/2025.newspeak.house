David is a technologist who wants to build radical technology to improve human lives. He is interested in projects that demonstrate an alternate vision for technology; a vision that centres and empowers everyday people rather than large corporations and the ultra-rich.

He currently works on improving collaborative research writing workflows at [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). Past projects that he is proud of include building a [patient deduplication system for a provincial government to improve vaccination coverage rates](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/combining-health-datasets-helping-polio-vaccination-efforts-pakistan) and launching [BBC Music Memories](https://musicmemories.bbcrewind.co.uk/home) - a site targeted at helping users with dementia reminisce.

He is based in Lewisham, enjoys running, and is an avid tabletop gamer.
