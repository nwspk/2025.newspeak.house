description: Making policy at the AI/Creative Industries intersection
---

I’ve spent 10 years making policy in central Government departments, working under multiple governments in a range of roles spanning refugee resettlement, renewable energy planning, and the COVID response. I found my niche where tech, society and policy meet, and now focus on strategic AI issues at the Department for Culture, Media, and Sport. I'm currently developing a proof of concept for a platform marketplace for the UK’s cultural and creative digital content: to give developers access to high quality data at scale, but with fair terms and pricing for the copyright owners.

More broadly, I’m interested in critiquing our relationship with evolving technologies through the lens of philosophy, looking at how recognition theory, and theories of justice, power, ethics and epistemology apply to our present day tech dilemmas.
