Fatima is an adventurous AI engineer and civic hacker working at the intersection of open source, developer tools, and public-interest technology.

She has a talent for storytelling and distilling complex concepts into approachable ideas.

As a Senior Developer Evangelist at GitLab, she prototypes early R&D ideas, teaches AI/ML through workshops, demos the product, and builds technical content that helps developers put new AI capabilities into practice.

Her career spans civic tech and public service across both the US and Canada: she served as a [Code for Canada Fellow](https://medium.com/code-for-canada/meet-the-2018-code-for-canada-fellows-595726b85817) on Transport Canada’s drones task force in Ottawa; a [Microsoft Civic Tech Fellow](https://blogs.microsoft.com/newyork/2015/07/09/whats-next-after-microsoft-civic-tech-fellow-alumni-fatima-khalid/) supporting NYC’s civic-tech ecosystem; [the sole engineer on the City of Boston’s Digital Team](https://web.archive.org/web/20170126043322/https://www.boston.gov/news/stacking-team-2016); [a long-time contributor](https://www.drupal.org/u/sugaroverflow) in globally distributed open-source communities like Drupal and WordPress, and the Chaos Wrangler at [Bad Idea Factory](https://biffud.com) - a collective of technologists who build  projects to make people thinking face emoji.

Her contributions have been recognized with awards including [the WCT Rising Star Award (2018)](https://blog.echidna.ca/fatima-khalid-rising-star-gets-recognized), [Dev Evangelist of the Year (2024)](https://devopsdozen.com/devops-dozen-2023-community-awards-winners/), and [coverage](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/code-for-canada-tech-talent-temporary-new-policy-needed-to-attract-1.5222477) in [industry press](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-be-a-better-ally-in-open-source-communities/).

Better known online as “sugaroverflow,” Fatima loves exploring ideas, connecting with humans, building things, and sparking curiosity. She’s powered by iced matcha lattes, science-fiction novels, sunsets by the ocean, and board games that take *at least* three hours.
