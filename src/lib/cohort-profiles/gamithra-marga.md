I am a person of machines, communities, and solarpunk futures. Of raves and robots. Of Windows XP, the last vision I remember holding of technology which has since learned to extract instead of empower. My favourite experience is Disco Elysium and my favourite technology is the dishwasher. I don't have a favourite color but dark blue is the worst of them.

I have been many things: startup founder, political party board chairman, hacker commune resident, Employee in Corporations. Each place had brilliant people building real things with real care. Each place was also, in its own way, optimizing for the wrong game, not because of moral capture, but because of the quiet pulls of misaligned incentives. I left those places with love and with grief and with [questions](https://mission.gamithra.com) that got more interesting over time.

Now I build strategic intelligence systems and think about Infrastructure That Cannot Be Captured, the systems that grow stronger when the old structures fail. I run [TVÍK](https://tvik.is), a language learning project that is both software and a manifesto. I run experiments on myself as an operating system, regularly observe the contents of my mind until formations dissolve, have [Guidelines](https://guidelines.gamithra.com) tattooed on my body, and [variables](https://status.gamithra.com) I use to measure how I'm doing.

I am interested in cybernetics, cultural economics, cyberanthropology, decision protocols at scale, the political technology of dancing until 6am, and what it might mean to fall in love with machines again.

I dream of visions for worlds with more time. Time to think of new beautiful things, time to listen to each other over cups of tea, time for the questions that actually matter. What should we have for dinner. Who is going to do the laundry. Does this person like me back. Is there anyone else out there. These are beautiful and they are the point.

The future is not inevitable like weather.
