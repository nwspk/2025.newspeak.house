Francesca is a writer, data analyst, visual artist, and management consultant interested in how interdisciplinary knowledge and technology can support stronger civic engagement.

Originally from Italy, she studied economics and political science at the University of Warwick, spent time at Sciences Po through Erasmus, and completed a policy internship in Washington, DC. Since 2019, she has worked with public- and private-sector clients on digital product management and data analytics at EY in London.

She writes [Magpie Brain](https://themagpiebrain.substack.com/), a Substack exploring the intersections of politics, history, art, and curiosity. She is active in online creative communities, participates in progressive political groups, and volunteers as a gallery guide at the British Museum. She has also supported third-sector organisations through DataKind UK.

At Newspeak House, she wants to work on civic-tech tools, experiment, and connect with others interested in building more just and participatory societies.
