description: Details on how to stay at the Newspeak House guest room
---

We keep a guest room at Newspeak House for visiting speakers, faculty, collaborators, and friends of the house. The room is managed by our fellows, and stays are arranged on a flexible, community basis.

**How it works:**

* Priority goes to invited speakers and visiting faculty, but we also welcome external guests when the room is free.  
* The room is simple but comfortable, with fresh linen and access to our shared kitchen, living areas, and co-working spaces.  
* We run the space on a **pay-what-you-feel basis** (£30–£80 per night), which covers cleaning and upkeep.  
* Stays are usually 1–7 nights. Longer visits are possible by special arrangement.

**How to request a stay:** 

Please email [Connor](mailto:c.dunlop@proton.me) or [Aadi](mailto:akuls23@gmail.com) with:

* Your name  
* The dates you’d like to stay (even if flexible)  
* A short note about who you are and your connection to the community

One of our fellows will be in touch to confirm availability and act as your Host during your stay.

We look forward to welcoming you.
