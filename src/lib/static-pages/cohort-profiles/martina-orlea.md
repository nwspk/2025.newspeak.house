Martina worked as a political campaigner across Europe and Asia for the last five years. She is Romanian, and her biggest win is helping Nicusor Dan become Romania's president. She believes that politics is the best tool to achieve sustainable, scalable change, so her purpose is to help the right people gain political power. She is interested in political technology from two angles: using digital communications to promote progressive candidates, and analysing and fighting the information warfare. She also dabbled a bit in technological means to build communities. 

She joined the course because she wants to be inspired, build a community of people who have not lost trust in politics, and learn how to build products.
