David is a technologist who wants to build radical technology to improve human lives. He is interested in forms of technology that:

- Distribute power rather than further concentrating it
- Are privacy perserving
- Bring people together rather than building a layer between them
- Are sustainable and open source
- Can be used in playful and creative ways to help people engage with political issues

He currently works on improving collaborative research writing workflows at [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). Past projects that he is proud of include building a [patient deduplication system for a provincial government to improve vaccination coverage rates](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/combining-health-datasets-helping-polio-vaccination-efforts-pakistan) and launching [BBC Music Memories](https://musicmemories.bbcrewind.co.uk/home) - a site targeted at helping users with dementia reminisce.

He is based in Lewisham, enjoys running, and is an avid tabletop gamer.
