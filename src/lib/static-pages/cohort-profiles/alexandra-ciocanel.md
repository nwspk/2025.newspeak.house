I’m a researcher examining how people interact with digital and AI-supported services, with experience working across government, academia, and industry. My practice is eclectic, shaped by sociology, anthropology and human-centred design. 

I’ve conducted extensive research in domains such as housing, household finance, climate change and sustainability, justice, and health, with a particular interest in the socio-cultural articulations of time, value, and knowledge. I currently work as a user researcher on digital interventions for the justice sector, and, drawing on previous academic research, ponder on the everyday realities of mortgage regulation: contracts that don’t hold, informed consents that burden, and signatures that make citizens responsible for systemic gaps.
